# profile_generator

This program asks the user a series of questions to get to know them better in order to generate a personalized profile blurb for their online profile.

## Fun Features I added for fun:

- Added personalized messages to output once user answers each message. 

- After the user finishes answering the survey it says "Thank you for your answes. Now generating profile blurb..." then a Spinner function executes which makes it look like it its actually generating a unique message.

- Delayed the profile blurb to console.log shortly after the spinner executes to add to that generating/loading experience

- Added a notification sound to play when the profile blurb is generated

- Added a final console log that thanks the user for using the profile generator before the readline instance closes.
